# discord-bot
#### A Discord Bot basic example project with event and command handler, essential commands and a pre-set database.

The only things you need to do to run the bot are the followings:

> 1. Set the environment variable for your Bot token in your .env file (or create one if it doesn't exist) in the following format: `TOKEN=your-bot-token` (you can find your bot token at https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
> 2. Open the config.js file and put your user ID in the appropriate property.
> 3. Open the terminal in your project folder.
> 4. Type in the terminal `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
> 5. Finally, type in the terminal `node main.js` to start the bot.

It is also recommended to set up **ESLint** for your project as it will significantly help you while developing. To get started, you can go to https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started.

If you're running your Bot on your PC without PM2, remember to always keep the console open if you want the Bot to stay online. If you want to stop it, just do CTRL + C or close the terminal.

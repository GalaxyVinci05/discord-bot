# discord-bot
This is a Discord Bot project that contains everything needed to make a Discord Bot in the easiest way (with explanations).

It contains the main (index) file, the config file and the package. Everything is already installed, the only things you have to do to activate your bot is:

1. Open the config.json file and put your bot token there (you can find your bot token at https://discord.com/developers/applications/), then save the file and close it
2. Open the command prompt in the project folder
3. Type in the command prompt "npm install" to install the node modules and create a package-lock.json file
4. Finally, type in the command prompt "node index.js" to run the bot

As you do this things the bot will run and finally be functional.

Remember to always keep the command prompt open if you want your bot to stay online. If you want to stop it, just close the command prompt.

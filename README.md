# discord-bot
A Discord Bot project that contains everything needed to make a Discord Bot in the easiest way (with explanations).

It contains the main (index) file, the config file and the package. The only things that you have to do to run the bot are the followings:

1. Open the config.json file and put your bot token there (you can find your bot token at https://discord.com/developers/applications/), then save the file and close it.
2. Open the terminal in the project folder.
3. Type in the terminal "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
5. Finally, type in the terminal "node index.js" to start the bot.

Remember to always keep the console open if you want your bot to stay online. If you want to stop it, just do CTRL+C or close the console.

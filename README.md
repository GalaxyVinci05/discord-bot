# discord-bot
A Discord Bot basic template project with event and command handler and some example commands.

The only things you need to do to run the bot are the followings:

1. Set the environment variable for your Bot token in your .env file (or create one if it doesn't exist) in the following format: **TOKEN=your-bot-token** (you can find your bot token at https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2. Open the config.js file and put your user ID there, then save the file and close it.
3. Open the terminal in the project folder.
4. Type in the terminal "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
5. Finally, type in the terminal "node main.js" to start the bot.

If you're running the Bot on your PC, remember to always keep the console open if you want your Bot to stay online. If you want to stop it, just do CTRL + C or close the console.
